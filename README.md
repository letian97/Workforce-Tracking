###FUNCTION:
-take in details of site trip from engineers through dropdown list/ manual typing

-the details will be sent to manager via SMS 

-the details is also sent to the server so that report can be generated

-the name will be memorised by the app after using it the first time, and will display itself in the edit text next time the app is opened.  

-If the input item intended is not in the drop down list, it allows user to type it manually. By ticking the check box, edit text for "from", "to", and "description" will replace dropdown list to allow typing.  
 
####OBJECTIVE:
-asist in management of project engineers, by keeping track of their trips to companies' site

-enable report to be generated efficiently. Instead of having a clerk to type in all the engineers' site activities in the excel spreadsheet manually, the report now can be exported from the server's database easily

-make calculating project job costing easier. The total number of hours spent by project engineers on various company sites can now be easily obtained from the server database for calculation purpose.
